Calculator Application with C# and UWP
This Application Creates the view and functionality that is expected in a simple calculator.
The styling is reactive to the user's Windows theme, 
   and will change based on the accents and light-mode/dark-mode.
This calculator includes the functionality to both type the operators/operand on the keyboard,
  or optionally click them on the screen.
